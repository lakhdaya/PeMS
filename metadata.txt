Name	Comment	Units
Timestamp	The date and time of the beginning of the summary interval. 
		For example, a time of 08:00:00 indicates that the aggregate(s) contain measurements 
		collected between 08:00:00 and 08:59:59. Note that minute and second values are always 0 
		for hourly aggregations. The format is MM/DD/YYYY HH24:MI:SS.	 
Station	Unique station identifier. Use this value to cross-reference with Metadata files.	 
District	District #	 
Route	Route #	 
Direction of Travel	N | S | E | W	 
Lane Type	A string indicating the type of lane. Possible values (and their meaning are:
CD (Coll/Dist)
CH (Conventional Highway)
FF (Fwy-Fwy connector)
FR (Off Ramp)
HV (HOV)
ML (Mainline)
OR (On Ramp)
 
Station Length	Segment length covered by the station in miles/km.	 
Samples	Total number of samples received for all lanes.	 
% Observed	Percentage of 5-minute lane points that were observed (e.g. not imputed).	%
Total Flow	Sum of 5-minute flows over the hour. Note that the basic 5-minute rollup normalizes   Veh/Hour
		flow by the number of good samples received from the controller.	
Avg Occupancy	Average of 5-minute station occupancies over the hour expressed as a decimal number between 0 and 1.	%
Avg Speed	Flow-weighted average of 5-minute station speeds. If flow is 0, mathematical average of 5-minute station speeds.	Mph
Delay (V_t=35)	The average delay over the station length, with respect to a threshold speed of 35 mph.	 
Delay (V_t=40)	The average delay over the station length, with respect to a threshold speed of 40 mph.	 
Delay (V_t=45)	The average delay over the station length, with respect to a threshold speed of 45 mph.	 
Delay (V_t=50)	The average delay over the station length, with respect to a threshold speed of 50 mph.	 
Delay (V_t=55)	The average delay over the station length, with respect to a threshold speed of 55 mph.	 
Delay (V_t=60)	The average delay over the station length, with respect to a threshold speed of 60 mph.	 
Lane N Flow	Sum of 5-minute flows for lane N over the hour. Note that the basic 5-minute rollup normalizes flow by the number of good samples received from the controller. N ranges from 1 to the number of lanes at the location.	Veh/Hour
Lane N Avg Occ	Average of 5-minute occupancies for lane N over the hour expressed as a decimal number between 0 and 1. N ranges from 1 to the number of lanes at the location.	%
Lane N Avg Speed	Flow-weighted average of 5-minute lane N speeds. If flow is 0, mathematical average of 5-minute lane speeds. N ranges from 1 to the number of lanes at the location.	Mph
